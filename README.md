## 1. Presentation <a name="presentation"></a>
This Python program is an offline management tool running in a terminal
for the organization of chess tournaments using the swiss-system.
***

## 2. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
This program runs under python 3.9 in a virtual environment.  
Thus, it is usable on Windows, Unix-based operating systems
insofar as the followings are installed:
- python 3.9 (including pip3)
- virtualenv

__Linux__  
_installation of python3.9:_    
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa    
$ sudo apt update     
$ sudo apt install python3.9    
_installation of pip3:_     
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py     
$ python3.9 get-pip.py    
$ pip --version    
_Installation of virtualenv :_      
$ sudo apt install virtualenv    

__Mac__  
_installation of python3.9 and pip3:_  
$ brew install python@3.9    
(pip3 comes along with it) 
if not, download and install the file get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py    
$ py get-pip.py       
_Installation of virtualenv :_    
$ pip3 install virtualenv
  
__Windows__     
_installation of python3.9 and pip3:_  
Download and install python 3.9 for windows from python.org    
(pip3 comes along with it)     
if not, download and install the file get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py    
$ py get-pip.py     
_Installation of virtualenv :_   
$ pip install virtualenv

## 6. Generation of a code review report <a name="generation_of_a_code_review_report"></a>
__flake8_html__    
_Launch the Analysis_
(at the project root level)    
$ flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report . -v   

format = format of the report (html)
htmldir = name of the directory to be created to store the report (mandatory)
. = current directory
-v = verbose (optional)

(from anywhere in the system)       
$ flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report --config [path/to/config/file] [path/to/project/root/] -v          
config = the file is named 'setup.cfg and is located at the root of the project (mandatory if not in the working directory)     

see more options here:  
https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html  
note: setup.cfg file excluding files from the analysis 
and setting te limit to 119 characters per line  

to read the reports:  
- browse files to the 'flake-report' directory
- open the file index.html in a webbrowser
